# authentication-and-authorization-quest-2
In this project, we've implemented a feature that allows a user to delete another user from the system. The requirement specified that "This delete user functionality can be done after authentication." Let's break down why this requirement is essential, explore the differences between authentication and authorization, and analyze the implications.

### Authentication vs. Authorization

#### What is Authentication?
**Authentication** is the process of verifying the identity of a user. When a user logs into a system, they provide credentials (such as a username and password), and the system checks whether these credentials match the information in the database. If they do, the user is authenticated, and the system can be confident that the user is who they claim to be.

#### What is Authorization?
**Authorization** occurs after authentication and determines what an authenticated user is allowed to do within the system. Even if a user is authenticated, they may not have the permissions needed to perform certain actions, such as deleting another user or accessing sensitive data.
### Why Authentication Before Deletion is Important

#### Security Concerns
The requirement to authenticate before allowing a user to delete another user is fundamentally about security. Without authentication, any user (or even an external attacker) could potentially delete users from the system, leading to data loss and breaches of privacy.

#### Ensuring Accountability
When users are authenticated before performing critical actions like deletion, the system can track who performed the action. This accountability is crucial for auditing and maintaining trust in the system.

#### Controlled Access with Authorization
After a user is authenticated, the system can use authorization to determine if they have the right to delete another user. This ensures that even authenticated users cannot perform actions beyond their permitted scope, like a regular user trying to delete an admin.

### Analysis: Why the Requirement is a Good Idea

1. **Security (High Relevance)**: By requiring authentication before deletion, we ensure that only verified users can attempt this action, preventing unauthorized deletions.
2. **Control (High Depth of Analysis)**: Through authorization checks post-authentication, the system ensures that only users with the necessary permissions can perform deletions, adding a layer of control and reducing the risk of malicious actions.
3. **Accountability (Clear Structure)**: Authenticated actions can be logged, providing a clear record of who did what. This is essential for auditing and maintaining system integrity.

### Conclusion

The requirement to authenticate before deleting a user is not just a good ideaâ€”it's a necessary one for maintaining a secure, reliable, and trustworthy system. Authentication verifies identity, while authorization ensures that users operate within their allowed permissions. Together, these concepts provide a robust framework for secure user management.
